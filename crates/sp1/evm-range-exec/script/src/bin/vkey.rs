//! A simple utility to extract and print the verifier key for the `evm-range-exec-program` zkVM circuit.
//!
//! This program initializes an SP1 prover client and performs a one-time setup to compute
//! the proving and verification keys for the ELF binary. It then prints the verification key
//! in hex format (as a 32-byte hash) to stdout.
//!
//! You can run this script using the following command from the root of this repository:
//! ```shell
//! cargo run -p evm-range-exec-script --bin vkey --release
//! ```
